Netbeans Platform Module for management of open source distributed software


The idea behind this tool is to provide a Plugin for Netbeans that allows easier management of open source
distributed software.  Currently I'm the only one working on it in my spare time.  At this point you can build a list
of Accumulo tables, add a Storm Nimbus Server to a Tree, and deploy a storm topology.
