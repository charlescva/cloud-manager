Netbeans Platform Module for management of open source distributed software

Updated 12/28/2013

The idea behind this tool is to provide a Plugin for Netbeans that allows easier management of open source distributed stacks.  

Some of the targeted software platforms are:

Apache Accumulo 1.4/1.5
Cloudera CDH3u6 and/or 4u5
Storm 0.8.2 (nathanmarz)
Zookeeper (cdh)
RPMs for CentOS 6.x
anything else...

Currently I'm the only one working on it in my spare time.  At this point you can build a list
of Accumulo tables by specifying host name, add a Storm Nimbus Server to a saved list of servers, deploy a storm topology, and quick browse to the storm ui.

I will continue to add more features as time permits.
